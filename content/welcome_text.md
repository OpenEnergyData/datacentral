Hey -- You just got Datacentral working!

If you haven't already, copy the `settings.conf.sample` file to `settings.conf`, and edit the new file to edit the datasets to be listed.

This sidebar is a good place to tell your visitors what this site is about in a few paragraphs. You can edit this in `content/welcome_text.md`.

Have fun with data!
