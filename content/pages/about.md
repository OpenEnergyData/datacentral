# About

**Datacentral** is a lightweight platform to easily publish and distribute datasets. It uses the [Data Packages](http://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/) specification as a common format to provide datasets.

By collecting datasets on this portal, we hope to make it easier for developers to plug them into their projects.

See the [Frictionless Data vision](http://frictionlessdata.io/about/) to understand why it is crucial to think about dataset packaging and distribution.

For more information about this project see [centraldedados/datacentral](https://github.com/centraldedados/datacentral).
