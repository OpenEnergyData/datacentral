# About

**Datacentral** is a static site generator to easily publish and distribute datasets. It uses the [Data Packages](http://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/) specification as a common format. By collecting datasets on this portal, we make it easier for developers to plug data into projects. See the [Frictionless Data vision](http://frictionlessdata.io/about/) for more background.

For example data packages, browse the [github.com/datasets](https://github.com/datasets) organisation.

There is an [online authoring](https://create.frictionlessdata.io/) and [validation tool](https://datahub.io/tools/validate) for data packages. On CKAN portals, the [datapackager extension](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-datapackager) allows exporting datasets as data packages. You may be interested in using [Goodtables.io](http://goodtables.io/) and other tools from the [Frictionless Data Labs](https://frictionlessdata.io/tooling/labs/).

The Datacentral platform was initially developed for [Central de dados](http://centraldedados.pt/) project by [Open Knowledge Portugal](https://okfn.org/network/portugal/), [Journalism++](http://jplusplus.org/), and other open-source [contributors](https://github.com/centraldedados/datacentral/graphs/contributors).
