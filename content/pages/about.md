# About

**Datacentral** is a lightweight platform to easily publish and distribute datasets. It uses the [Data Packages](http://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/) specification as a common format to provide datasets. By collecting datasets on this portal, we hope to make it easier for developers to plug them into their projects. See the [Frictionless Data vision](http://frictionlessdata.io/about/) to understand why it is crucial to think about dataset packaging and distribution.

There is a [validation tool](http://data.okfn.org/tools/validate) developed by Open Knowledge available. For example data packages, browse the [github.com/datasets](https://github.com/datasets) organisation.

If you are a data publisher and use CKAN, install the [datapackager extension](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-datapackager) to share your datasets in this format.

For more information and to submit issues to the team running this specific instance see [schoolofdata-swiss/datacentral](https://github.com/schoolofdata-swiss/datacentral/).

The Datacentral platform was initially developed for the [Central de dados](http://centraldedados.pt/) project by [Open Knowledge Portugal](https://okfn.org/network/portugal/) and [Journalism++](http://jplusplus.org/).
