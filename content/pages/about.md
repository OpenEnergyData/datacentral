# About

**Datacentral** is a lightweight platform to easily publish and distribute datasets. It uses the [Data Packages](http://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/) specification as a common format to provide datasets.

By collecting datasets on this portal, we hope to make it easier for developers to plug them into their projects. See the [Frictionless Data vision](http://frictionlessdata.io/about/) to understand why it is crucial to think about dataset packaging and distribution.

For more information or to submit issues see [schoolofdata-swiss/datacentral](https://github.com/schoolofdata-swiss/datacentral/).

The Datacentral platform was initially developed for the [Central de dados](http://centraldedados.pt/) project.
